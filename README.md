# LWAI, Long Weather AI

From commandline, run 
```
python -m lwai
```

## Summary

This program connects to datasources to get weather history. This is used to predict next summer weather.

## Background

LWAI will act as support in decision making when working with longer weather forecasts. 

## How is it used?

```
python -m lwai
```

TODO:
Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

## Data sources and AI methods

Some curl examples are stored in [curl-examples.sh](/curl-examples.sh)

TODO:
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

TODO:
What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

TODO:
How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
